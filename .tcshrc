# The following line does not need to be uncommented.  It is here for
# informational purposes only.  All tcsh shells automatically source the
# etc/tcsh/cshrc file when started up.  Variables from this file may be
# overridden below by experienced shell programmers.

# if ( -f /usr/local/etc/tcsh/cshrc ) source /usr/local/etc/tcsh/cshrc

# For tcsh, we want to get both the csh environment, and tcsh specific
# enhancements.  In order to do that, we get the user's csh environment
# (which should include a global csh environment) and any global tcsh
# settings.  The first line should NOT be commented out.  It is safe
# to comment out the second since no vital part of the CISE environment
# will be set in the tcsh specific file.

if ( -f ~/.cshrc ) source ~/.cshrc
if ( -f /usr/local/etc/Tcshrc.global ) source /usr/local/etc/Tcshrc.global

# If for some reason you comment out the lines above, you shuld still
# read the global environment.  To do so, uncomment the following line
# or lines (the first is necessary, the second is optional).

# if ( -f /usr/local/etc/Cshrc.global ) source /usr/local/etc/Cshrc.global
# if ( -f /usr/local/etc/Cshrc.aliases ) source /usr/local/etc/Cshrc.aliases

# Make any personal additions below.  The following are strongly discouraged
# for any but the most experienced shell programmers:
#    o  overriding the path set above
#    o  prepending directories to the path
# Please be familiar with shell programming before making any changes to
# your .tcshrc file.

# ===========================================================================
#
# Note to users:
#   No path should ever start with '/depot' or '/amd'.  If you are using
#   paths that start with either of these, you should know that these are
#   not guaranteed to work and will change over time (without notice).  You
#   should determine what the correct path is (which probably starts with
#   /usr or /cise).
